    <h2>Character biography</h2>

    <p class="biography"> It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Where's Einstein, is he with you? What did I just say? Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Are you okay?<br><br>
        
    George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? What? Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Yeah, where does he live? Maybe you were adopted.<br><br>
        
    Right. Ah. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?<br><br>
